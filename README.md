- Technologies Used:
| HTML
| CSS
| JQuery
| Javascript

- Approach Taken:
I decided to layout the board first so I could have a visual. Bootstrap made making the game grid easy. 
I made sure that all of my elements in my HTML file had classes. That way it would be easy to style my page and use javascript and JQuery. 
Once I got to my JS file I decided I needed event listeners for the board, a winner function, a function that decides what player goes first and then switches it and a play function to make it all run.  
So I started with those funcions. After my one on one I realized that I need to focus on making individual elements work well so that they ran smootly together. So a checklist was written. 

[x] CLick let's play to initilize game

[x] Once clicked it will determine first player and announce it 

[x] Player one will click and thier symbol will go down

[x] Switch player

[x] Player two will click and thier symbol will go down

[x] Determine winner

[x] Anounce winner

[x] Track winner/scores

[x] Next Game button that will reset the board

[x] Start over button that will reset wins and board 


Having this checklist made sure that all the things I needed were there.
